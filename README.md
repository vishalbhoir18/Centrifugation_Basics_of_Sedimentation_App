# Centrifugation: Basics of Sedimentation App

This Streamlit web app allows users to visualize the sedimentation process under varying conditions of particle and buffer properties, as well as centrifugal force. The app dynamically simulates the movement of particles in a test tube using an interactive animation.

## Features
- Adjust particle size, density, and buffer properties via the side panel.
- Modify centrifugal force to observe changes in sedimentation rate.
- Real-time animation of particle movement within a test tube.
- Interactive visualization using custom HTML and CSS animations.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
